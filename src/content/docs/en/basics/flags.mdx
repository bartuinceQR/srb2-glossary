## PAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS

Frequently, you can see operations like “if player.cmd.buttons & BT_CUSTOM1”. But what does that & do? 

It follows the bit logic we discussed earlier, of course! True to its name, it compares one bit of one value and one bit of the other value, and checks if they are both 1s.
0100 0011
0011 1111
________&
0000 0011

A simplified way to understand this would be to consider it a logic puzzle.
-If “A” is true and “B” is true, only THEN will “C” be true.

The “or” operation, | , follows the same principle, but instead of checking A AND B are true, it checks if A OR B are true.

What does this have to do with SRB2 code, then? The point is, most “flags” in the game, whether it be object flags, button presses, player flags, are stored in individual bits, so that they may each be separately checked with the AND operation without clashing with each other.

PF_GODMODE -> 16 -> 0001 0000
PF_NOCLIP -> 32      ->  0010 0000

The 8 bits here are an example, the actual number is way larger (should be 32 bits)

PF_FORCESTRAFE -> 268435456 -> 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
The AND operation

The player field that checks these flags, player.pflags, is also an integer value, and it can have any number of these flags. To find if we have a PARTICULAR flag, we use the AND operation to essentially filter it out and see if the result is positive.

player.pflags -> 23 ->       0001 0111
PF_AUTOBRAKE -> 8 -> 0000 1000

0001 0111
0000 1000
________&
0000 0000

The player does NOT have the PF_AUTOBRAKE flag! That would make sense, since the flag numbers are 1 + 2 + 4 + 16, which correspond to four other pflags. (https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Constants#Internal_player_flags)

A Minor Pitfall:

player.pflags & (PF_FLAG1 | PF_FLAG2) will return true if EITHER of those flags are enabled, not BOTH of them.

player.pflags & (PF_FLAG1 & PF_FLAG2) will NEVER return true.

Simply check for multiple conditions separately. There IS a way to make it a single line, but it involves hard-to-read negation notations, so try to avoid it.

The OR Operation

On the other hand, the | operation is much simpler. It only exists to add a flag to a number. If it already has that flag, then this operation does nothing, and is completely harmless.

player.pflags -> 23 ->       0001 0111
PF_AUTOBRAKE -> 8 -> 0000 1000

0001 0111
0000 1000
________|
0001 1111
player.pflags now includes PF_AUTOBRAKE! If it already had it, the result would have been exactly the same.

A Minor Pitfall:

The & operation is for checking, the | operation is for setting. Usually, you’ll want to do,

player.pflags = $ | PF_FLAG1

Changing the value of the field.

player.pflags = $ & PF_FLAG1

Would result in you either ONLY having FLAG1 if you already had it, or NO flags if you didn’t. 

Negation:

player.pflags = $ & ~PF_FLAG1

Would result in ONLY FLAG1 being removed from you.

Let’s pretend PF_FLAG1 = 0010 0000
Then its inverse would be = 1101 1111

The AND operation is completely harmless when used against “1”s, simply returning the result you put in. This means every bit will remain unchanged, EXCEPT for where the flag bit used to be, which will be forced into being 0, removing the flag if it existed in our number. If it wasn’t there, nothing happens.
