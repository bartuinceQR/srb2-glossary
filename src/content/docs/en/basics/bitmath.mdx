Bits are 0s and 1s, the “binary” language you hear about a lot. It’s very similar to our daily usage of digits, it only goes up to 1 instead of 9.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12… normal
0 1 10 11 100 101 110  binary

Knowing the exact values of numbers in binary isn’t really relevant to Lua, but it IS important to know for bit mathematics.

Treat binary numbers like they’re normal numbers, just use “2” when you would use “10”. 110 isn’t 10^2 + 10^1 + 0, for example. It’s 2^2 + 2^1 + 0, which is 6.

```x << 3``` means shifting x three digits to the left, which means adding three 0s to its right. This is the same as multiplying it by 2^3 = 8. Very similar to how we multiply by 1000 to add three 0s in normal mathematics.

```1110 (14 = 8 + 4 + 2)``` becomes ```1110000 (112 = 64 + 32 + 16)```.

x >> 3 means shifting x three digits to the right, which means removing the last three digits, regardless of their value. This is the same as dividing it by 2^3 = 8. Yes, this means we can lose accuracy in our number, that’s the truth of math without complicated floating point stuff.

1010 (10) becomes 1 (1). Divided by 8, the result is 1, and the remainder (2) is lost forever.


Upper / Lower Bits
When a SOC Action makes mention of Upper / Lower 16 bits, it’s referring to values over and under 65536, respectively.

If you enter a value of “2048”, that’s the lower 16 bits.
2048 is 2^11, so in binary, we can represent it with a 1 followed by eleven zeroes. Sort of like how we represent

0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 0000 0000 

If you enter a value of “2048 \<\< 16”, you shift it 16 digits to the left, which is the same as multiplying it by 2^16, which is 65536. At this point:

0000 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 

2048 has become your UPPER value.
If you want an upper value of 1, and a lower value of 2048, for example, you would write:

2048 + 1 \<\< 16

Alternatives:
The constant FRACBITS seems to be designed for this purpose. 
The expressions 3 \<\< 16 and 3 \<\< FRACBITS are exactly the same thing.
The constant FRACUNIT is 65536, which equals 1 \<\< 16. 
The expressions 3 \<\< 16 and 3 * FRACUNIT are also exactly the same thing.
