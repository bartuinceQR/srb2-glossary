Hi chat

I've finally decided to stop being lazy and make a general purpose and accessible Lua glossary for everyone to read! I'll update it as I receive more questions and learn more concepts myself. It's extremely barebones right now, but as I figure out more of Astro.js (The framework this site was made in), things might get more elaborate and more visually engaging.

**Note to any readers**: If you find yourself stumped about a topic and want me to give it a quick rundown, ping me on any shared Discord servers we have, or leave a comment in the MB thread! (I am not on the SRB2OS, don't bother looking there)
