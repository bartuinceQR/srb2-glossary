Hi chat

I've finally decided to stop being lazy and make a general purpose and accessible Lua glossary for everyone to read! I'll update it as I receive more questions and learn more concepts myself. It's extremely barebones right now, but as I figure out more of Astro.js (The framework this site was made in), things might get more elaborate and more visually engaging.

**Note to any readers**: If you find yourself stumped about a topic and want me to give it a quick rundown, ping me on any shared Discord servers we have `(@zipperqr)`!

**Welcome to Astro 2.0!**

This is the `docs` starter template.
It contains all of the features that you need to build a Markdown-powered documentation site, including:

- 📝 **Full Markdown and MDX support**
- 📱 **Responsive mobile-friendly design**
- 🧭 **Sidebar navigation**
- 🔎 **Search (powered by Algolia)**
- 🔤 **Self-Hosted webfont (GDPR compliant)**
- 🗨️ **Multi-language i18n**
- 📃 **Automatic table of contents**
- 🧑‍💻 **Automatic list of contributors**
- 🌙 (and, best of all) **dark mode**

## Getting Started

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.

Found a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it on Discord [(#ideas-and-suggestions channel)](https://astro.build/chat) and even consider adding it yourself on GitHub! Astro is an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow!

Good luck out there, Astronaut. 🧑‍🚀
