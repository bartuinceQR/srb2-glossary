## PAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS

If you’ve ever messed around with the SRB2’s Lua pages, you’ve hopefully noticed the Hooks page. Here, you might have seen a definition that looks like this:
Hook format: `addHook("MobjThinker", functionname, [int objecttype])`
Function format: `function(mobj_t mobj)`
Function return value: `Boolean (override default behavior?)`


Hooks essentially provide the basis for the main way of interacting with the game, but what do each of these mean?


Hook Format:
The “addHook” function built inside SRB2, is what allows you to connect your function to a step in the game’s process, quite literally “hooking” it into the game loop. This step can be many things: Processing inputs, running the logic of a particular enemy on the map, drawing on the HUD… Each of these steps come with their own name for their hooks.


For example, “MobjThinker”, the example provided above, is run every frame, during the step of the game that loops through each Mobj (map object, basically every “thing” that is spawned on the map when you load it), and runs their Thinkers. Most of the time, this’ll just update their SOC states and not do much else, but more complex enemies have specialised Thinkers that are not normally accessible either by Lua or SOC. The most important part is where our hook comes in. When we attach a hook into that step, it runs before the game does its usual thing, allowing us to precede the game’s logic with our own.


When we add the hook, we write the type of the hook (“MobjThinker”), and we provide the name of the function that will be inserted into the hook.

```
local function TestFunction(mo)
	print(“Don’t print every frame, are you crazy?”)
end
```

The name of the function would be TestFunction in this case, written without quotes, as we want to pass the function itself as an argument, not its string name.


The third argument, surrounded by [square brackets], is optional. It accepts an object type, such as MT_RING or MT_EGGMOBILE2. This allows you to apply this hook to only a certain object type, so that you do not have to manually check for the object type inside the function every frame. If you want to apply it to multiple objects, you’ll still need to write an “addHook” line for each of them, or run a “for” loop. No way to do it in a single line, apologies. If this argument is left blank, the function will apply to every single Mobj, including ones that are created after loading the map.


Quick Note:
MF_NOTHINK will prevent a MobjThinker function from running.


Function Format:
When you add a hook, you need to follow the function format exactly. Adding fewer arguments than what is given will not work. Adding more arguments than what is given MIGHT work on the surface, but is very unhealthy to try and should be avoided.
MobjThinker is very simple. As it applies itself upon a single Mobj, it requires exactly one argument, which is the Mobj that will be affected.
This does not mean that you need to find a Mobj on the map and give it to the function. The hook handles that part itself. You simply need to make sure that you treat your argument like a Mobj.
https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Lua/Userdata_structures
Without getting into specifics, “treating it like a Mobj” means that you need to be mindful of the “mobj_t” table found on the link above. You can change its x,y,z position, flags, height etc. What you CANNOT do is try to access “mo.cmd.buttons”, for example. cmd is in the player table, NOT available to Mobjs. You can, of course, CREATE a field in your Mobj called “cmd”, then edit it later. You simply need to be mindful of what you do have. That’s the biggest benefit of Lua modification. You can expand the tables of mostly anything.

```
local function TestFunction(mo)
	print(“X position : “ .. tostring(mo.x))
end
```

This makes any Mobj with this hook attached print its X position every frame. Since the x coordinate is part of the Mobj table, we can freely access it.


Quick Note:
If you are working with the Mobj of a player, you can access their player table with mo.player. You can also access the player field of non-Player objects, but it’ll just return nil.


Of course, not all hooks are this simple. 
`function(mobj_t target, mobj_t inflictor, mobj_t source, int damage, int damagetype)`
This is the function format for MobjDamage. At first glance, it might be intimidating. You need a mobj of “target”, “inflictor” and “source”, and two additional arguments for damage and the type of damage. The last two are relatively easy to understand, they are how much damage the mobj has taken, and what KIND of damage it has taken, respectively. You can increase/decrease/nullify the damage taken inside the function freely. For the first three, keep in mind that they’re still Mobjs, despite what we call them in the function format. The “target” is the victim being hurt. The reason for “inflictor” and “source”s existence is due to projectiles. Fang’s corks are the inflictor, Fang is the source. Same goes for most enemies who throw projectiles.


> Quick Note:
The source is decided by the inflictor’s target. In a confusing mess of decision making, Doom’s projectiles follow logic such that they CANNOT hurt their target, that’s why their target is always set to the one who spawns them.


>Quick Note:
**THE ORDER OF ARGUMENTS IN THE FUNCTION FORMAT ARE IMPORTANT.**

```
local function TestMobjDamageFunction(target, inflictor, source, dmg, dmgtype)
	print(“Z position : “ .. tostring(inflictor.z))
end
```

```
local function TestMobjDamageFunction(inflictor, target, source, dmg, dmgtype)
	print(“Z position : “ .. tostring(inflictor.z))
end
```

The first function will print the inflictor’s z position. The second function will print the target’s z position, as it’s ALWAYS the first argument in the function for the hook. What name you give it inside the function definition does not matter to the game itself. It’s only important for you to remember what each argument does.

```
local function TestMobjDamageFunction(target, dmgtype, source, dmg, inflictor)
	print(“Z position : “ .. tostring(inflictor.z))
end
```

This one’s just silly. It’ll give an error, as the “inflictor” is actually the damagetype field, which is a number with no “z” field to speak of.


Function Return Value:


You might have noticed some functions “return true” or “return false”. For functions connected to hooks, these return values have special properties. For example, for “MobjThinker”, returning true means we want to COMPLETELY override whatever that object’s original Thinker is. For something like ShouldDamage, however, the return value decides whether the damage process should be started, with “return nil” letting the game’s default checks do the work instead. These return values are not mandatory, but can be helpful for overriding default mechanics that can be considered counterintuitive, such as bosses moving to their PainState every time they are hit, resetting their attack cycle.
